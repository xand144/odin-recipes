# odin-recipes

This is the first of a series of projects that I am completing for The Odin Project, an online self-paced full-stack web development course. 

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to practise the basic HTML knowledge that I have acquired thus far, by creating a simple website with a homepage which links to several other pages, each displaying a different recipe, with an image. It has also given me the chance to get comfortable with the basics of the Git workflow.

## Things I learned to use HTML for:

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Lists
- Hyperlinks
- Displaying images
- **Bolding** and *italicising* text
- Changing the title of a webpage in the browser tab

## Recipe Credits

- Tofu Doner Kebab: Derived from https://atinybitvegan.com/vegan-tofu-doner-kebab/
- Rocky Road: My mum's recipe &lt;3
- Macaroni & Cheese: taken from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238691/simple-macaroni-and-cheese/ (after haphazardly converting some of the units to metric)
