            <li>150g golden syrup</li>
            <li>150g dark cooking chocolate, broken into pieces</li>
            <li>300g milk cooking chocolate, broken into pieces</li>
            <li>250g Biscoff biscuits, chopped into chunks</li>
            <li>4 Cadbury's Crunchie bars, chopped into chunks</li>
            <li>100g mini marshmallows</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salted caramel flavouring</li>
            <li>100g white chocolate (optional for decorating the top)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place marshmallows and chunks of Biscoff and Crunchie into a large bowl, and leave it aside.</li>
            <li>Put butter cubes and golden syrup in a different cooking bowl, and create a water bath by placing it in a saucepan of boiling water.</li>
            <li>Stir until butter melts and mixture approaches boiling point, then add salted caramel flavouring.</li>
            <li>Remove bowl from heat and add in all cooking chocolate pieces, stirring until chocolate melts completely and mixture has a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients that you prepared in step 1, and mix well.</li>
            <li>Evenly spread resulting mixture on baking paper in a rectangular dish, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>For the optional white chocolate top decoration, break some white chocolate into pieces, put them inside a piping bag, and immerse in boiling water to melt. Then simply squeeze out the melted chocolate onto the rocky road in whatever pattern you wish.</li>
            <li>And you're done! All that's left is to cut the rocky road into pieces. Try not to eat too much at once! ;&#41;</li>
        </ol>
