        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Want an easy, meat-free meal reminiscent of a kebab? Look no further than this tofu doner recipe! It may not be the same greasy strips of lamb or chicken that you're used to, but give it a go and it may just scratch the itch!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
            <li>350g extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of a chilli sauce of your choice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp cornflour</li>
            <li>salt to taste (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Press your block of tofu and air fry it whole for 10 minutes, to dry out remaining liquid.</li>
            <li>For your marinade, mix together the soy sauce, chilli sauce, ketchup, cumin, salt, pepper, lemon juice and garlic in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Move one tablespoon of the marinade into a small dish and mix in the cornflour. This makes it easier for the cornflour to mix in, preventing lumps. Once mixed, add it back into the main bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the block of tofu has cooled enough to handle, use a potato peeler or a serrated knife to cut the block into thin slices, and place them in the marinade for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat up you pan with a bit of oil and fry the tofu for around 8-10 minutes, flipping each slice halfway through. It is best cook it in a couple of batches to ensure each slice of tofu has enough space on the pan.</li>
            <li>You're done! Serve your tofu hot and fresh with whatever flatbreads and sauces you wish. I recommend garlic mayo! :&#41;</li>
        </ol>
